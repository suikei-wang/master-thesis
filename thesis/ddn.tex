\chapter{Deep Declarative Network}
\label{cha:ddn}
In this chapter, we will cover the structure and nodes in the deep declarative network: from its learning process to the back-propagation.
\par Before delving into the details of the back-propagation in different constraints cases, we give an overview of the deep declarative network. The notations and the basic structure of the network
