The past two years at the Australian National University have been an invaluable experience for me. When I started my Master of Machine Learning and Computer Vision at the beginning of 2019, I could barely understand lectures, knew little about the country, and had never heard of the term "convex optimization". It is unbelievable that I have been doing a research project on this topic for a whole year. ANU has the top tier research group in this realm and how honored I am to be a postgraduate student here. 
\par First and foremost, I would like to express my deep and sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Stephen Gould. I knew Stephen before the admission of the program and how privileged I am to work and learn with one of the most brilliant minds in our field. He always has an insightful and high-level view on this topic. More importantly, Stephen is extremely kind and patient as he is always willing to discuss and share ideas with us during the weekly meetings. Although sometimes I am stuck in some problems he used to give me constructive suggestions. 
\par I would like to thank Dylan Campbell and Miaomiao Liu -- another two giants of the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision -- for offering my supervision and being my second examiner on my thesis. Dylan
