The past two years at the Australian National University have been an invaluable experience for me. When I started my Master of Machine Learning and Computer Vision at the beginning of 2019, I could barely understand lectures, knew little about the country, and had never heard of the term "convex optimization". It is unbelievable that I have been doing a research project on this topic for a whole year. ANU has a top tier of research in this realm, which also helps and supports me to complete my work. \\
First and foremost, I want to thank my supervisor, Stephen Gould. I knew Stephen before the admission of the program since he is famous in this area.
