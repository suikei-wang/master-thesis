\subsection{Orthogonal Matching Pursuit Algorithm}
In a linear system $Ax=b$, if $A$ is rank deficient, there are two problems. The first problem is that there is not be an exact solution at all. Since the range of $A$ does not span the entire $\mathbb{R}^n$ (if $A$ has $n$ columns) but only an $(N-1)$-dimensional subspace. In this case, we can solve exactly for $x$ only if $b$ is in this subspace. The second problem is that there are actually infinity solutions, since $A$ has a non-empty null space, which means that there is a 1-dimensional subspace of vectors $x$ that gives $Ax=0$. If we use the least-squares solution, the pseudoinverses of $A$ multiply by $b$, it provides a solution for both problems. For the first problem, it gives the closest $x$, which is also the one with the smallest $\|b-Ax\|$. At the same time, for the second problem, out of all solutions that share the smallest approximation error and it gives the one with the smallest norm, which is the minimum-norm solution. Therefore, applying the least-squares method to rank deficient may not be able to obtain the best solution for all columns in the matrix. 
\par We consider the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm (OMP), which is a greedy compressed approach widely used in signal recovery.
